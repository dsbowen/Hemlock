Together, they allow you to share and collaborate on hemlock projects. You will also need git to initialize hemlock projects with the hemlock template. Macs typically have git pre-installed, which you can verify: $ git --version git version 2.27.0.mac.1 If you don't have git, follow the download and installation instructions here . Then, create a github account here . Configure your github command line interface: $ git config --global user.name <my-github-username> $ git config --global user.email <my-github-user-email> For example, I would enter: $ git config --global user.name dsbowen $ git config --global user.email dsbowen@wharton.upenn.edu Finally, you will need a personal access token to initialize hemlock applications with the hemlock command line interface. Read everything until STOP before creating your github token. Create a github token by following these instructions . When setting permissions (step 7), check 'repo'. Copy your token and store it somewhere accessible. For example, I store my token in a file named github_token.txt . STOP. Visual studio code I recommend visual studio code for editing python files.

By the end of this part of the tutorial, you'll be able to set up comprehension checks. Click here to see what your blackboard.ipynb and survey.py files should look like at the end of this part of the tutorial. Why comprehension checks? We often give our participants instructions. To make sure they understand the instructions, we give them comprehension checks. Hemlock has a built-in tool for easy comprehension checks. The structure of a comprehension check is: One or more pages of instructions. One or more pages of 'checks'. If the participant fails a check, they return to the first instructions page. Participants do not have to repeat checks that they pass. We set a limit on the number of attempts participants have to pass each check. For example, suppose there are two checks, A and B. The participant passes check A but fails check B. He is brought back to the first page of the instructions. After rereading the instructions, he is brought directly to check B, skipping check A. (Think about what it would take to do this in Qualtrics, or program this from scratch). Basic syntax Although we usually start with jupyter, the logic of comprehension checks is best illustrated by running an app. Open app.py and replace import survey with import tmp_survey . Now make a new file, tmp_survey.py , and enter the following: from hemlock import Branch, Check, Compile as C, Page, Label, Submit as S, route from hemlock.tools import comprehension_check @route('/survey') def start(): return Branch( *comprehension_check( instructions=Page( Label('<p>Here are some instructions.</p>') ), checks=Page( Check( '<p>Select the correct choice.</p>', ['Correct', 'Incorrect', 'Also incorrect'], compile=[C.clear_response(), C.shuffle()], submit=S.correct_choices('Correct') ) ), attempts=3 ), Page( Label('<p>You passed the comprehension check!</p>'), terminal=True ) ) Run the app and play with the comprehension check. Notice that when you don't click the correct choice, the survey brings you back to the instructions page. Code explanation First, we import our standard hemlock objects and the comprehension_check tool. As usual, we return a branch from our navigate function. We begin the branch with a comprehension check. The comprehension check takes a list of instructions pages (or a single instructions page), a list of check pages (or a single check page), and the number of allotted attempts. The comprehension_check tool returns a list of instructions + check pages. The branch constructor expects pages, not a list of pages, to be passed in as arguments. The asterisk in *comprehension_check(...) means 'unlist' the list of instructions + check pages as you pass them into the branch constructor . The check page contains a Check question. Note that 'check' has different meanings here. A 'check page' in a comprehension check means a page where you test the participant's understanding of the instructions . A 'check question' means a question where you can check one or more choices . By default, the check question will record the participant's response and display the choices in their original order. These are both problems for testing comprehension. We don't want participants to simply click choices in order until the hit the right one. To fix this, we add two compile functions; one to clear the response, and one to shuffle the choices. A participant passes a check page when all of its questions' data evaluate to True . So, we'll add a submit function to the check question which converts its data to 1 if the participant selected the correct choice and 0 otherwise ( 1 and 0 evaluate to True and False in most programming languages). Finally, we set attempts=3 to give the participant 3 attempts to pass the check. If a participant fails the check 3 times, they'll simply continue the survey. We can require participants to pass the check by not passing an attempts parameter. Ultimatum game comprehension check We're going to use a comprehension check to explain the ultimatum game to our participants and test their understanding of it. First, open app.py and change import tmp_survey back to import survey . Instructions Open your notebook and let's preview the instructions page: from hemlock import Page, Label # the number of rounds participants play N_ROUNDS = 5 # the amount of money split POT = 20 Page( Label( ''' <p>You are about to play an ultimatum game. The game involves two players: a <b>proposer</b> and a <b>responder</b>. The proposer has ${} to split between him/herself and the responder. The responder names an amount of money such that he/she accepts any proposed split which gives him/her at least this amount, and rejects any proposed split which gives him/her less than this amount.</p> <p><b>If the split is accepted, the proposer and responder split the money according to the proposal. If the split is rejected, both players receive $0.</b></p> <p>You will play {} rounds of this game. Each round, you will be paired with another randomly selected participant. <b>You will rarely, if ever, play two rounds with the same player.</b> <p>We will test your understanding of these instructions on the next page.</p> '''.format(POT, N_ROUNDS) ) ).preview() Checks For the check pages, we're going to give participants a hypothetical proposal and response and ask them how much money the proposer and responder receive. We'll do this twice; once where the proposal is accepted, the other where it is rejected. Additionally, we want to avoid biasing participants' responses by giving them all the same hypothetical proposal-response pairs. So, we'll write a function to randomly generate proposals. Enter the following in your notebook: from hemlock import Compile as C, Input def gen_check_page(accept): return Page( Label(), Input( '<p>How much money does the proposer receive?</p>', prepend='$', append='.00' ), Input( '<p>How much money does the responder receive?</p>', prepend='$', append='.00' ), compile=[C.clear_response(), C.random_proposal(accept)] ) @C.register def random_proposal(check_page, accept): # WE'LL WRITE THIS FUNCTION IN A MOMENT pass gen_check_page(accept=True).preview() The gen_check_page function generates a check page. The Label with which the page starts is going to be populated by a randomly generated proposal-response pair which we'll create with the compile function random_proposal . Both gen_check_page and random_proposal take an accept argument which indicates whether the proposal will be accepted or rejected. Now, fill in the random_proposal function in the same notebook cell: from hemlock import Compile as C, Input, Submit as S from random import randint ... @C.register def random_proposal(check_page, accept): # randomly generate a proposed split and response n = randint(1, POT-1) proposal = POT-n, n # proposer receives POT-n, responder receives n response = randint(0, n) if accept else randint(n+1, POT) # compute the payoff payoff = proposal if response<=proposal[1] else (0, 0) # describe the proposal and response in the label check_page.questions[0].label = ''' <p>Imagine the proposer proposes the following split:</p> <ul> <li>Proposer: ${}</li> <li>Responder: ${}</li> </ul> <p>The responder says, \"I will accept any proposal which gives me at least ${}.\"</p> '''.format(*proposal, response) # add submit functions to verify that the response was correct check_page.questions[1].submit = S.match(str(payoff[0])) check_page.questions[2].submit = S.match(str(payoff[1])) gen_check_page(accept=True)._compile().preview() random_proposal begins by generating a random proposal. We then generate a random response which will accept the proposal if accept is True and reject the proposal if accept is False . The payoff is the proposal if the proposal is accepted and (0,0) if the proposal is rejected. We then fill in the check page's label with the proposal and response. Finally, we add submit functions to the check page's input questions to verify that the participant's responses match the payoffs. Adding a comprehension check to our app Let's put this all together in survey.py : ... from hemlock.tools import comprehension_check, join from datetime import datetime from random import randint # the number of rounds participants play N_ROUNDS = 5 # the amount of money split POT = 20 ... @N.register def ultimatum_game(start_branch=None): return Branch( *comprehension_check( instructions=Page( # CONTENT OF INSTRUCTIONS PAGE HERE ), checks=[gen_check_page(accept=True), gen_check_page(accept=False)] ), Page( Label('<p>You passed the check!</p>'), terminal=True ) ) def gen_check_page(accept): # GEN CHECK PAGE FUNCTION HERE @C.register def random_proposal(check_page, accept): # RANDOM PROPOSAL FUNCTION HERE Run your app and see your comprehension check at work!

In this part of the tutorial, you'll implement a confirmation page using compile functions. Click here to see what your blackboard.ipynb and survey.py files should look like at the end of this part of the tutorial. Why compile functions? Compile functions run just before a page's html is compiled. This allows us to make our survey responsive to participants. In our case, we're going to make a confirmation page for the participant's demographic information. Basic syntax Open your jupyter notebook and run the following: from hemlock import Check, Compile as C check = Check( '<p>Select the correct answer.</p>', ['Correct', 'Incorrect', 'Also incorrect'], compile=C.shuffle() ) check.compile Out: [<Compile 1>] You can add compile functions to a page or question by setting its compile attribute or passing a compile argument to its constructor. Compile functions run just before a page's html is compiled. The shuffle compile function shuffles a question's choices. (Or, if attached to a page, shuffles its page's questions). Let's watch our compile function at work: check._compile() [choice.label for choice in check.choices] Out: ['Incorrect', 'Also incorrect', 'Correct'] Run this a few times and notice how the order of the choices changes. This behavior is useful for comprehension checks, as we'll see later. Notes. You don't need to run _compile yourself in the survey; hemlock takes care of this automatically for you. shuffle is just one of many prebuilt compile functions . Custom compilation We're going to take the participant's responses to the demographics page and display them on a new page. We'll ask the participant to correct any errors by going back to the demographics page. Let's see how to do this in our notebook: from hemlock import Input, Label, Page, Range, Select from hemlock.tools import join @C.register def confirm(confirm_label, demographics_page): # get the participant's data from the demographics page demographics = [q.data for q in demographics_page.questions] # re-format the race demographic data race = demographics_page.questions[2] race = join('and', *(key for key in race.data if race.data[key])) demographics[2] = race # set the label based on the participant's demographics data confirm_label.label = ''' <p>Confirm the following information:</p> <ul> <li>Date of birth: {}</li> <li>Gender: {}</li> <li>Race/Ethnicity: {}</li> <li>Marital status: {}</li> <li>Subjective socio-economic status: {}</li> </ul> <p>To correct this information, click '<<'.</p> '''.format(*demographics) demographics_page = Page( Input(data='10/26/1992'), Check(data='Male'), Check(data={'White': 1, 'Black': 1}), Select(data='Never married'), Range(data='5') ) confirm_page = Page( Label(compile=C.confirm(demographics_page)), back=True ) confirm_page._compile().preview() Code explanation First, we register a new compile function with the @C.register decorator. The compile function takes the confirmation label as its first argument. In general, compile functions take their parent as their first argument. We also pass in the demographics page as the compile function's second argument. Next, we add a back button to the page with back=True . Then, we compile and preview the page. confirm begins by gathering the demographics data from the demographics page. The data are well formatted to insert into our confirmation page except for race. For Check and Select questions, if the participant can select multiple choices, the data are stored as a dictionary mapping choice values ( 'White' , 'Black' , etc.) to a 0-1 indicator that the participant selected that choice. We fix this with the following: from hemlock.tools import join race_data = demographics_page.questions[2].data race = join('and', *(key for key in race_data if race_data[key])) demographics[2] = race Note that race_data[key] evaluates to True if the key ( 'White' , 'Black' , etc.) was selected. So the expression (key for key in race_data if race_data[key]) means 'get all the keys (races) the participant selected'. The expression join('and', *(key for key in race_data if race_data[key])) means 'join all of the selected keys with \"and\", e.g. \"White and Black\"'. Finally, confirm adds the demographics to the confirmation label.

Then, we compile and preview the page. confirm begins by gathering the demographics data from the demographics page. The data are well formatted to insert into our confirmation page except for race. For Check and Select questions, if the participant can select multiple choices, the data are stored as a dictionary mapping choice values ( 'White' , 'Black' , etc.) to a 0-1 indicator that the participant selected that choice. We fix this with the following: from hemlock.tools import join race_data = demographics_page.questions[2].data race = join('and', *(key for key in race_data if race_data[key])) demographics[2] = race Note that race_data[key] evaluates to True if the key ( 'White' , 'Black' , etc.) was selected. So the expression (key for key in race_data if race_data[key]) means 'get all the keys (races) the participant selected'. The expression join('and', *(key for key in race_data if race_data[key])) means 'join all of the selected keys with \"and\", e.g. \"White and Black\"'.

Click here to see what your blackboard.ipynb and survey.py files should look like at the end of this part of the tutorial. Previewing data from a single participant Each participant contributes data to a data frame which you can download. We'll start by looking at the data belonging to a 'test participant'. Run the following in your jupyter notebook: from hemlock import Participant part = Participant.gen_test_participant() dict(part.get_data()) Out: {'ID': [1], 'EndTime': [datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552)], 'StartTime': [datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552)], 'Status': ['InProgress']} This shows the data our test participant contributes to the data frame. The keys are variable names, and values are list of entries for that variable. An easy way to add data is with 'embedded data': from hemlock import Embedded part.embedded = [Embedded(var='MyVariable', data='MyData')] dict(part.get_data()) Out: {'ID': [1], 'EndTime': [datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552)], 'StartTime': [datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552)], 'Status': ['InProgress'], 'MyVariable': ['MyData'], 'MyVariableOrder': [0], 'MyVariableIndex': [0]} This adds an Embedded data object to our participant. Embedded data are a type of data element, like questions, but unlike questions, are not displayed to participants. We can add embedded data to a participant, branch, or page. When we examine the data, we see that the participant has a new variable named 'MyVariable' with data ['MyData'] . We also see two additional variables named 'MyVariableOrder' and 'MyVariableIndex' . Hemlock automatically adds order and index data for every data element. Order is the order in which this data element appeared in the survey, relative to other data elements belonging to the same variable. Index is the order in which this data element appeared in its parent's list of children; for example, the order in which a question appeared on its page. Ordering The order in which data elements appear in the data frame is the order in which they were created; not necessarily the order in which they appear to the participant. For example: embedded1 = Embedded('MyVariable', 1) embedded0 = Embedded('MyVariable', 0) part.embedded = [embedded0, embedded1] dict(part.get_data()) Out: {'ID': [1, 1], 'EndTime': [datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552), datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552)], 'StartTime': [datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552), datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552)], 'Status': ['InProgress', 'InProgress'], 'MyVariable': [1, 0], 'MyVariableOrder': [1, 0], 'MyVariableIndex': [1, 0]} Note that the data for 'MyVariable' are [1, 0] because we created embedded1 before embedded0 . Data rows By default, data elements (embedded data and questions) contribute 1 row to the data frame. But we often want the same data to be repeated on multiple rows. We do this by setting the data_rows attribute: part.embedded = [Embedded('MyVariable', 'MyData', data_rows=3)] dict(part.get_data()) Out: {'ID': [1, 1, 1], 'EndTime': [datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552), datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552), datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552)], 'StartTime': [datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552), datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552), datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 8, 11, 46, 54, 462552)], 'Status': ['InProgress', 'InProgress', 'InProgress'], 'MyVariable': ['MyData', 'MyData', 'MyData'], 'MyVariableOrder': [0, 0, 0], 'MyVariableIndex': [0, 0, 0]} Additionally, we often want to 'fill in' rows of a variable to match the length of a data frame. For example, we may not know in advance how many rows a participant will contribute to the data frame, but we know that we want the participant's demographic information to appear on all rows. To do this, we set data_rows to a negative number. For example, data_rows=-2 means 'fill in two rows with this data entry and, when you download the data, fill in any blank rows after this with the same data': part.embedded = [ # these data will fill in empty rows at the bottom of the data frame Embedded('MyFilledVariable', 'MyFilledData', data_rows=-1), # these data will appear on three rows of the data frame Embedded('MyVariable', 'MyData', data_rows=3) ] dict(part.get_data())['MyFilledVariable'] Out: ['MyFilledData', 'MyFilledData', 'MyFilledData'] Adding data to our survey We can add data to our existing survey in much the same way: by setting a question's var and (when necessary) data_rows attribute. We generally want demographics information to appear in all rows of the data frame, so we'll set data_rows=-1 . In survey.py : ... @route('/survey') def start(): return Branch( Page( Input( '<p>Enter your date of birth.</p>', placeholder='mm/dd/yyyy', var='DoB', data_rows=-1 ), Check( '<p>Indicate your gender.</p>', ['Male', 'Female', 'Other'], var='Gender', data_rows=-1 ), # SET THE `var` AND `data_rows` ATTRIBUTES FOR THE REST OF THE QUESTIONS ... Downloading data Run your survey locally, fill in the demographics page, and continue to the end of the survey. Your data will be recorded in the database. To download your data, navigate to http://localhost:5000/download in your browser. Select 'Data frame', then click the download button. This will download a zip file containing your data in .csv format. Take a look at the data. In addition to what we've already covered, there are a few things to notice: Variables like GenderMaleIndex and GenderFemaleIndex record the order in which a question displayed its choices. The data of questions for which you can select multiple choices are automatically one-hot encoded. For example, if RaceWhite and RaceAsian are both 1, and the rest of the race variables are 0, this means means the participant is part White and part Asian.

By the end of this part of the tutorial, you'll be able to use hemlock's debugging tool to make sure your app is running smoothly. Click here to see what your blackboard.ipynb and survey.py files should look like at the end of this part of the tutorial. Why a custom debugging tool? In the early days of hemlock, I coded a study in which I asked participants to estimate the ages of people in photographs. I used a submit function to change their data from strings to integers. Everything was running smoothly until one mischievous participant entered 'twenty-seven', breaking my survey and sending me home in a fit of rage. Since then, I've rewritten my submit functions to be more fault tolerant. If you run from hemlock import Input, Submit as S Input(data='twenty-seven', submit=S.data_type(int))._submit().data it doesn't break; it simply converts the data to None . But that wasn't good enough. We often underestimate just how strangely participants will respond to our studies in ways that we can't foresee. To mitigate this problem, I wrote a custom debugging tool for hemlock. The tool sends an AI participant through your survey to check things out. 'AI participant' is a bit of a misnomer; if anything, it's an artificially stupid participant. It clicks random buttons, enters random things into inputs and text boxes, drags range sliders to random values; basically stress testing your code. Setup To run hemlock's custom debugging tool locally, you'll need Google Chrome and Chromedriver . Check out the setup page for your OS for specific instructions: Windows Windows Subsystem for Linux Mac Linux Basic syntax Open your jupyter notebook and run the following: from hemlock import Debug as D, Input inpt = Input(debug=D.send_keys('hello world')) inpt.debug Out: [<Debug 1>] You can add debug functions to a page or quesiton by settings its debug attribute or passing a debug argument to its constructor. Debug functions run when we run the debugger (in just a moment). As its name suggests, the send_keys debug function tells the AI participant to send keys to the input. Let's watch our debug function at work: from hemlock import Page from hemlock.tools import chromedriver driver = chromedriver() p = Page(inpt) p.debug.pop() p.preview(driver)._debug(driver) First, we use chromedriver to open Chromedriver with selenium python . Next, we create a page with our input question. We then pop the last debug function from the page we created. Why? By default, pages have two debug functions. The first executes its questions' debug methods in random order; as if the participant were randomly jumping between questions on a page. The second debug function randomly clicks a forward or back button (if it exists), or refreshes the page. Popping the last debug function prevents the debugger from navigating, which allows us to see more clearly what the debugger is doing in preview mode. Finally, we run the debug function. You'll notice it enters 'hello world' in the input. After you're done, close the driver: driver.close() Notes. You don't need to run _debug yourself in the survey; hemlock takes care of this automatically for you. send_keys is just one of many prebuilt debug functions . Default debug functions We can attach debug functions to pages or questions. Most questions have a default debug function. For example, input questions have a default debug function which sends random ASCII characters to the input. You can see the default debug function at work by running: p = Page(Input()) p.debug.pop() p.preview(driver)._debug(driver) However, sometimes we need to attach additional debug functions. For example, our study begins by asking participants to enter their date of birth in mm/dd/yyyy format. If you wait for the default debug function to randomly enter a string which matches that pattern, you might not end up running your study before Trump releases his tax returns. Instead, we'll use something like: Input( '<p>Enter your date of birth.</p>', debug=D.send_keys('10/26/1992') ) Unfortunately, this will not work effectively as a debugger. Sometimes we want the debugger to enter nonsense, and sometimes we want it to enter something sensible. To specify this behavior, we can modify the above: Input( '<p>Enter your date of birth.</p>', debug=[D.send_keys(), D.send_keys('10/26/1992', p_exec=.8)] ) The first debug function, send_keys() , sends random keys to the input. The second debug function send_keys('10/26/1992') , sends '10/26/1992' to the input. We also pass p_exec=.8 to the second debug function, which specifies its probability of executing. In English, we're telling the debugger, enter something random, then, with 80% probability, enter something sensible . Custom debug functions We won't need custom debug functions for our survey, but you may need them elsewhere. Creating custom debug function is similar to creating custom compile, validate, etc. functions, with one important difference: while the functions you've seen take their parent as their first argument, debug functions take a selenium webdriver as their first argument and their parent as their second argument: @D.register def f(driver, parent): # debug something If you're serious about writing custom debug functions, I recommend checking out the source code for inspiration. Debugging our app First, import Debug at the top of survey.py : from hemlock import Branch, Check, Compile as C, Debug as D, Embedded, Input, Label, Navigate as N, Page, Range, Select, Submit as S, Validate as V, route ... Our app can be debugged largely with default debug functions. The exceptions are, 1) the date of birth input, 2) the comprehension check, 3) proposals and responses. Date of birth Modify survey.py as follows: ... @route('/survey') def start(): demographics_page = Page( Input( '<p>Enter your date of birth.</p>', ... debug=[D.send_keys(), D.send_keys('10/26/1992', p_exec=.8)] ), ... Comprehension checks Because there is no attempt limit for our comprehension check, unless we tell the debugger to enter the correct answers, it's going to keep looping back to the instructions page. ... @Compile.register def random_proposal(check_page, accept): ... check_page.questions[1].debug = [ D.send_keys(), D.send_keys(str(payoff[0]), p_exec=.8) ] check_page.questions[2].debug = [ D.send_keys(), D.send_keys(str(payoff[1]), p_exec=.8) ] ... Proposals and responses It's unlikely the debugger will enter an integer between 0 and the size of the pot, so we'll give our debugger some help: ... def gen_proposal_input(round_): return Input( ... debug=[D.send_keys(), D.send_keys(str(randint(0, POT)), p_exec=.8)] ) ... ... def gen_response_input(round_): return Input( ... debug=[D.send_keys(), D.send_keys(str(randint(0, POT)), p_exec=.8)] ) ... Run the debugger Now that our debugger won't get stuck in any infinite loops, it's time to run it. Open another terminal window. As always, change to your project directory and activate your virtual environment: $ cd $ cd my-first-project Activate from git bash on Windows: $ . hemlock-venv/scripts/activate Activate from Mac or WSL: $ . hemlock-venv/bin/activate You should have 3 terminals open: one for jupyter, one for editing survey.py and running hlk serve , and now a third for running the debugger. In one of the terminal windows, run the hemlock app as usual ( hlk serve ). In the third terminal, run the debugger with hemlock-CLI: $ hlk debug To run several AI participants through the survey, e.g. 3, use: $ hlk debug -n 3 Summary In this part of the tutorial, you learned how to debug your app with hemlock's custom debugging tool.

In this part of the tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy your application (a.k.a. put it into production or put it on the web). Setup The easiest way to deploy web apps is with heroku . Hemlock-CLI builds on the heroku-CLI for deployment. Find the setup page for your OS for specific instructions: Windows Windows Subsystem for Linux Mac Linux Debugging in a staging environment Before we deploy our project 'for real', we're going to deploy to a staging environment using free heroku resources and run our debugger one more time. Why? Because the production environment is subtly different from your local environment, which can cause problems in very rare cases. The staging environment is virtually identical to the production environment, so if things go well in staging, our app should run smoothly in production. Deploying your app in staging Deploying your application is as easy as: $ hlk deploy You'll be redirected to a page on the heroku website. If this is your first time deploying an app, heroku will prompt you to connect to your github account. Once you're on the heroku page, make the following modifications to your application configuration: Enter a name for your application. Set your PASSWORD . You will need to enter this password to log in to the researcher dashboard to access your data. Set your URL_ROOT . For example, if your project is named my-first-project235 , your URL_ROOT would be https://my-first-project235.herokuapp.com . This tells the debugger where to look for your app. Click 'Deploy app' and watch the magic happen. In 2-3 minutes, your survey will be online. Running the debugger In the last part of the tutorial, we ran our debugger in the local environment. Now, we're going to run it in staging. First, let's hook up our project to our online application: $ heroku git:remote -a <my-app-name> Replacing <my-app-name> with your application name. For example, if your application is named my-first-project235 , you'd enter: $ heroku git:remote -a my-first-project235 Now, run the debugger: $ hlk debug --staging This is almost exactly what we did in the previous part of the tutorial. The difference is that we added the --staging flag, indicating that we're running the debugger in the staging environment. Where's the webdriver? In production, Chromedriver needs to run in 'headless' mode, meaning you won't be able to see the debugger going through the survey in your browser. You will, however, see it going through pages in the terminal window. Hopefully the debugger runs smoothly. If it doesn't, fix your code, update your application, and run the debugger again. Update your application with: $ hlk update Once you're satisfied that your app is as error-free as possible, we'll destroy the staging version to 'make room' for the production version: $ heroku apps:destroy Deploying your application We're finally ready to deploy our application for real . This is basically the same process as deploying to the staging environment, with a few small changes. First, open app.json : $ code app.json We're going to modify this to give us more powerful compute resources. At the top of the file, we'll change our addons and formation from: { \"addons\": [\"heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev\"], \"formation\": { \"web\": {\"quantity\": 1, \"size\": \"free\"} }, ... to: { \"addons\": [\"heroku-postgresql:standard-0\"], \"formation\": { \"web\": {\"quantity\": 10, \"size\": \"standard-1x\"} }, ... Let's deploy our app and set our configuration variables like we did before: $ hlk deploy Enter a name for your application. Set your PASSWORD . Set your URL_ROOT . New step. Set DEBUG_FUNCTIONS to False . This stops your application from creating debug functions. We're not going to run the debugger again at this point, so debug functions will just slow things down. Like before, click 'Deploy app' at the bottom of the page. Your app is now online, ready to send to the world! Don't forget to download your data, and destroy your application when you're finished: $ heroku apps:destroy -a <my-app-name> Cost How much will it cost me to play around with my app in production? Answer: $0.10. Calculation: This formation gives us a standard-0 database ($50/mo) and 10 standard-1x 'dynos' (like servers, $25/mo/dyno * 10 dynos = $250/mo). That's $300/mo total. Heroku prorates by the second, meaning that if you mess around with the app for 15 minutes, you'll be charged $300/mo * 1 mo/30 days * 1 day/24 hours * 1 hour/60 min * 15 min = $0.10. How much will it cost me to run a study with these resources? Answer: $5. Do the same math, but assume your study is online for half a day. Side note. The exact amount of compute power you need depends on the application. My recommendation for a standard-0 database and 10 standard-1x web dynos is a rough recommendation that will work well for most academic studies. Read more about heroku resources here .

What you need to get started: Git and github (and a github authentication token) Python3 and pip3 Hemlock-CLI Visual studio code Jupyter Google chrome Check out the setup page for your OS: Windows Windows Subsystem for Linux Mac Linux Initialize a new hemlock project Run the following, replacing <my-github-username> with your github username and <my-github-token> with your github authentication token: $ hlk init my-first-project <my-github-username> <my-github-token> For example, I would enter: $ hlk init my-first-project dsbowen bts4rxpmw2x6tsy2qel1y7p5hwmhd7wxopmk5vsp (This isn't my real authentication token!) This will 'clone' the template into a folder my-first-project , initialize an eponymous github repository for your project, and create a virtual environment.

Set up your virtual environment Activate your virtual environment. Activate from git bash on Windows: $ . hemlock-venv/scripts/activate Activate from Mac, Linux, or WSL: $ . hemlock-venv/bin/activate Next, install the required python packages to run this project locally: $ pip install -r local-requirements.txt You may see an error message starting with Cannot uninstall PyYAML . This means that all of your packages were successfully installed except for pyyaml . To fix this, run: $ pip install --ignore-installed pyyaml Once you've installed the required packages, add your virtual environment to jupyter: $ python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=hemlock-venv It's good practice to use virtual environments and activate them whenever you're working on a project. Note. You will only have to pip install the requirements and add hemlock-venv to jupyter once per project. However, you will have to activate your virtual environment every time you open a new terminal to work on this project. That is, suppose you close and re-open your terminal. You will have to change directory into your project folder and re-activate the virtual environment. If using WSL If using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you'll need to specify your distribution as an environment variable. Open a file which specifies your local environment variables: $ code env.yaml And add the following line: WSL_DISTRIBUTION: Ubuntu-20.04 # or other WSL distribution If you're not sure which distribution you have, run: $ explorer.exe .

Preview a page in jupyter notebook Jupyter notebook is a great tool for iterating quickly on project designs. I recommend using it for most of your work. Open the jupyter dashboard with: $ jupyter notebook Jupyter will attempt to open the dashboard automatically in your browser. If this fails, the terminal window will show you links to the dashboard that you can manually copy and paste into your browser. Open the file named blackboard.ipynb .

Start with the end product in mind When learning to program - or anything else - start with the end product in mind. This is my spin-off of Covey's start with the end in mind , where the end is something you've produced rather than knowledge you've acquired. I personally find that aiming at a product makes me more knowledgable about a topic than aiming at knowledge itself. In this spirit, our goal is to create a behavioral study in which participants play an ultimatum game with each other in real time. You can see the end product here: https://hemlock-tutorial.herokuapp.com/ . The complete survey code is on github . The ultimatum game is famous; studied in hundreds of academic papers in disciplines such as game theory, behavioral economics, experimental economics, marketing, psychology, sociology, and neuroscience. It involves two players; a proposer and a responder . We begin by endowing the proposer with a 'pot' of (usually) money, e.g. $20. The proposer then proposes a 'split' of the pot between him/herself and the responder (e.g. I get $15, you get $5 ). The responder can accept or reject the proposed split. If the responder accepts, the pot is split according to the proposal (e.g. proposer gets $15, responder gets $5). If the responder rejects the proposal, both players get nothing. With nearly 2000 citations, this 1991 American Economic Review paper studies how play evolves over successive rounds. It finds that proposers usually make 'fair' offers (about a 50-50 split), and responders usually reject unfair offers, in early rounds. As the game continues, proposers make more unfair offers, and responders are more accepting of them. The study we'll make in the hemlock tutorial is designed to replicate this finding.

By the end of this part of the tutorial, you'll be able to set up navigation between branches. Click here to see what your blackboard.ipynb and survey.py files should look like at the end of this part of the tutorial. Why navigate functions? Navigate functions move participants through different branches of the survey. For example, participants in the control group might follow one branch, while participants in the treatment group follow another. In our case, we'll use a navigate function to bring participants from the demographics branch of our survey to an 'utlimatum game' branch. In this branch, participants will an ultimatum game with each other. Basic syntax Open your jupter notebook and run the following: from hemlock import Branch, Navigate as N, Page, Participant def start(): return Branch( Page(), Page(), navigate=N.end() ) @N.register def end(start_branch): return Branch(Page(terminal=True)) part = Participant.gen_test_participant(start) part.view_nav() Out: <Branch 1> <Page 1> C <Page 2> C = current page T = terminal page You can add navigate functions to a branch or page by setting its navigate attribute or passing a navigate argument to its constructor. Navigate functions bring participants to a new branch when they have completed the branch or page to which the navigate function belongs. Code explanation Unlike validate, submit, and compile functions, there are no prebuilt navigate functions. We register a custom navigate function with the @N.register decorator. The navigate function takes the start branch (the branch returned by start ) as its first argument. In general, navigate functions take an 'origin' branch or page as their first argument. Navigate functions return a Branch object. part.view_nav() prints the participant's 'branch stack'. Right now the participant is on the branch created by start . Let's make our test participant navigate forward and view the navigation again: part.forward().view_nav() Out: <Branch 1> <Page 1> <Page 2> C C = current page T = terminal page And again: part.forward().view_nav() Out: <Branch 1> <Page 1> <Page 2> <Branch 2> <Page 3> C T What happened? Our participant reached the end of the start branch (branch 1) and navigated to the end branch (branch 2). It's currently on page 3, which is the last (terminal) page of the survey. Note. You won't call view_nav or forward in the survey; hemlock takes care of the navigation automtically for you. These are just useful for debugging in jupyter. Branching off pages Branching off of branches allows us to navigate to a new branch at the end of our current branch. But occasionally, we'll want to navigate to a new branch from the middle of our current branch. To do this, we'll branch off of a page. This time, instead of attaching the navigate function to the branch, we'll attach it to the first page of the branch: def start(): return Branch(Page(navigate=N.middle()), Page(terminal=True)) @N.register def middle(start_branch): return Branch(Page()) part = Participant.gen_test_participant(start) As before, run part.view_nav() and part.forward() a few times. This is what you'll see: <Branch 1> <Page 1> C <Page 2> T <Branch 1> <Page 1> <Branch 2> <Page 3> C <Page 2> T <Branch 1> <Page 1> <Branch 2> <Page 3> <Page 2> C T What happened? We started on the first page of the start branch (branch 1, page 1). Then, we branched off of page 1 to the middle branch (branch 2, page 3). At the end of the middle branch, we picked up where we left off on the start branch (branch 1, page 2). Navigating back You'll often want to allow participants to navigate to a previous page. To do this, simply set a page's back attribute to True , or pass back=True to a page's constructor. You can also navigate backward in the notebook.

In this part of the tutorial, you'll implement the proposer branch of the ultimatum game. Click here to see what your blackboard.ipynb and survey.py files should look like at the end of this part of the tutorial. The proposal input First, we'll write a function to generate an input question where the proposer will input the proposed split. Enter the following in your jupyter notebook: from hemlock import Input, Label, Page, Submit as S, Validate as V N_ROUNDS = 5 POT = 20 def gen_proposal_input(round_): return Input( ''' <p><b>Round {} of {}</b></p> <p>You have ${} to split between you and the responder. How much money would you like to offer to the responder?</p> '''.format(round_, N_ROUNDS, POT), prepend='$', append='.00', var='Proposal', validate=V.range_val(0, POT), submit=S.data_type(int) ) Page(gen_proposal_input(1)).preview() This function generates an input which asks the proposer how much money they would like to offer to the responder. We record the data in a variable named 'Proposal' . We add range validation so that the proposer inputs an integer between 0 and the size of the pot. We also add a submit function which converts the data type to an integer. Note. For input questions, the data are recorded as strings. We want to reference this question's data as an integer, so we use S.data_type(int) to convert it when the page is submitted. Finding a responder We can use the SQLAlchemy Query API to pair the proposer with a random responder this round. In our notebook, we'll create an input question with the variable name 'Response' . We'll then use the Query API to get all input questions with that variable name and select the data from one of them at random: import random response_input = Input(var='Response', data=5) response_inputs = Input.query.filter( Input.var=='Response', Input.data!=None ).all() random.choice(response_inputs).data Out: 5 As expected, this matches the data from our response input. Displaying the proposer outcome Now we want to display the outcome of the round to the proposer. This calls for a compile function: from hemlock import Compile as C, Embedded from random import randint @C.register def proposer_outcome(outcome_label, proposal_input): # get the proposal proposal = POT-proposal_input.data, proposal_input.data # get all responses response_inputs = Input.query.filter( Input.var=='Response', Input.data!=None ).all() if response_inputs: # randomly choose a response response = random.choice(response_inputs).data else: # no responses are available # e.g. if this is the first participant response = randint(0, POT) # compute the payoff accept = response <= proposal[1] payoff = proposal if accept else (0, 0) # record results as embedded data outcome_label.page.embedded = [ Embedded('Response', response), Embedded('Accept', int(accept)), Embedded('ProposerPayoff', payoff[0]), Embedded('ResponderPayoff', payoff[1]) ] # describe the outcome of the round outcome_label.label = ''' <p>You proposed the following split:</p> <ul> <li>You: ${}</li> <li>Responder: ${}</li> </ul> <p>The responder said they will accept any proposal which gives them at least ${}.</p> <p><b>Your proposal was {}, giving you a payoff of ${}.</b></p> '''.format( *proposal, response, 'accepted' if accept else 'rejected', payoff[0] ) proposal_outcome_page = Page( Label( compile=C.proposer_outcome(Input(data=10)) ) ) proposal_outcome_page._compile().preview() Let's go through this step by step. First, we get the proposal from the proposal input question. Remember that we converted the data for this input to an integer using a submit function. The data for this input is the amount of money the proposer offered to the responder, meaning that the proposed split is (POT-proposal_input.data, proposal_input.data) . Second, we use the Query API to randomly select a response input question. We modify our above code to account for the fact that, if the first participant is a proposer, there won't be any responses to choose from. So, if our query can't find any response input questions, we return a random response. Third, we compute the payoff and record the results of the round using embedded data. Finally, we set the outcome label's label attribute to display the outcome of the round. Notice that the outcome of the round is recorded in the proposer's outcome page's embedded data: [(e.var, e.data) for e in proposal_outcome_page.embedded] Out: [('Response', 5), ('Accept', 1), ('ProposerPayoff', 10), ('ResponderPayoff', 10)] Adding the proposer branch to our survey Navigating to the proposer branch We'll begin by modifying the ultimatum game branch to navigate to the proposer branch if the participant was assigned to be a proposer. In survey.py : ... @N.register def ultimatum_game(start_branch=None): proposer = assigner.next()['Proposer'] return Branch( # COMPREHENSION CHECK HERE Page( Label( ''' <p>You are about to play an ultimatum game as a <b>{}</b>.</p> '''.format('proposer' if proposer else 'responder') ) # DELETE terminal=True ), navigate=N.proposer_branch() ) ... The proposer branch navigate function Next we'll add our proposer navigate function to the bottom of survey.py : ... import random # ADD THIS IMPORT AT THE TOP OF THE FILE from datetime import datetime from random import randint ... @N.register def proposer_branch(ultimatum_game_branch): branch = Branch() for round_ in range(N_ROUNDS): proposal_input = gen_proposal_input(round_+1) branch.pages.append(Page(proposal_input)) branch.pages.append(Page( Label(compile=C.proposer_outcome(proposal_input)), cache_compile=True )) branch.pages.append(Page( Label('<p>Thank you for completing the hemlock tutorial!</p>'), terminal=True )) return branch This navigate function simply adds two pages to the proposer branch for each of N_ROUNDS . The first page asks the proposer to propose a split. The second page displays the outcome of the round. Notice that passed cache_compile=True to the second page. This caches the result of the compile functions; removing them so that they won't run again if the participant refreshed the page. Why do we want to do this? Suppose we set up our study so that participants are playing for real money. We don't want participants refreshing their screen over and over again to see if they can get a better outcome. Generating the proposal input and outcome label Finally, we'll add the gen_proposal_input and proposer_outcome functions we wrote in our notebook: ... def gen_proposal_input(round_): # AS IN THE NOTEBOOK @C.register def proposer_outcome(outcome_label, proposal_input): # AS IN THE NOTEBOOK Run the app and see what the survey looks like in the proposer condition.

We add placeholder='mm/dd/yyyy' , telling participants the expected format of their date of birth. The next two are check questions, which allow participants to check one or more choices. Notice that the first check question allows participants to check only one choice; we allow participants to check multiple choices in the second check question by passing multiple=True . The fourth question is a select (dropdown) question. If we wanted, we also could have passed multiple=True to its contructor to allow participants to select multiple options. Our final question is a range slider. By default, it goes from 0 to 100, but we set its range from 0 to 10 here.

In the previous part of the tutorial, we created and previewed a page in a jupyter notebook. Hemlock + jupyter notebook is great for trying out ideas and iterating quickly, like working on a blackboard. However, it won't create a fully responsive application (survey). For that, we're going to need to run our app locally. Open a second terminal window You should have jupyter running in a terminal window from the previous part of the tutorial. You'll need to restart the kernel (in the navigation bar at the top of blackboard.ipynb click Kernel >> Restart & Clear Output) before running your app. Note. You will always need to restart your jupyter notebook kernel before running your application to avoid a database error. Open a second terminal window.

Code explanation After our imports, we use the @route('/survey') decorator to register our first 'navigate' function. This essentially tells our application, 'start here'. Navigate functions direct the 'survey flow'. All navigate functions return Branch objects. A branch contains a list of pages which it displays to participants. We set a branch's pages by passing them as arguments to the constructor, or by setting a branch's pages attribute, meaning that the following are equivalent: b = Branch(Page(Label('<p>Label 0</p>')), Page(Label('<p>Label 1</p>'))) b = Branch() b.pages = [Page(Label('<p>Label 0</p>')), Page(Label('<p>Label 1</p>'))] We also passed a keyword (named) argument to the page constructor, terminal=True . This tells the application 'end here'. Workflow In the previous part of the tutorial, we designed a page in jupyter notebook. In this part of the tutorial, we used that design in our survey file.

Our demographics page asks participants to enter their date of birth. In addition to date of birth, we also want to record the participant's age. Submit functions run after a participant submits a page and their responses are validated. We're going to attach a submit function to our date of birth input question to record our participants' age as embedded data. Basic syntax Open your jupyter notebook and run the following: from hemlock import Input, Submit as S inpt = Input('<p>Enter \"hello world\"</p>', submit=S.match('hello world')) inpt.submit Out: [<Submit 1>] You can add submit functions to a page or question by settings its submit attribute or passing a submit argument to its constructor. Submit functions run when a participant successfully submits a page. The match submit function changes a question's data to 1 if the data matches a regex pattern, in this case 'hello world' , and 0 if it does not. Let's set the input question's data and watch our submit function work: inpt.data = 'hello world' inpt._submit().data Out: 1 inpt.data = 'something other than hello world' inpt._submit().data Out: 0 Notes. You don't need to run _submit yourself in the survey; hemlock takes care of this automatically for you. match is just one of many prebuilt submit functions . Custom submission We're going to use a custom submit function to record our participants' age. Let's see how to do this in our notebook. from hemlock import Embedded, Page from datetime import datetime @S.register def record_age(inpt): # calculate age in years date_of_birth = datetime.strptime(inpt.data, '%m/%d/%Y') age = (datetime.utcnow() - date_of_birth).days / 365.25 # record age as embedded data inpt.page.embedded = [Embedded('Age', age, data_rows=-1)] page = Page( Input('<p>Enter your date of birth.</p>', submit=S.record_age()) ) inpt = page.questions[0] inpt.data = '10/26/1992' inpt._submit() page.embedded[0].data Out: 27.742642026009584 Code explanation We register a new submit function with the @S.register decorator. The submit function takes the input question as its argument. In general, submit functions take their parent as their first argument. record_age converts the input's data to a datetime object, computes the participant's age, and records it as embedded data. Submission in our app Now that we've seen how to add submit functions in our notebook, let's add it to our app. In survey.py : from hemlock import Branch, Check, Embedded, Input, Label, Page, Range, Select, Submit as S, Validate as V, route from datetime import datetime @route('/survey') def start(): return Branch( Page( Input( '<p>Enter your date of birth.</p>', placeholder='mm/dd/yyyy', var='DoB', data_rows=-1, validate=[V.require(), V.date_format()], submit=S.record_age() ), # REST OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS PAGE HERE ), Page( Label('<p>Thank you for completing the survey!</p>'), terminal=True ) ) ... @S.register def record_age(inpt): # calculate age in years date_of_birth = datetime.strptime(inpt.data, '%m/%d/%Y') age = (datetime.utcnow() - date_of_birth).days / 365.25 # record age as embedded data inpt.page.embedded = [Embedded('Age', age, data_rows=-1)] Run the app again, fill in the demographics page, and download the data. You'll now see a variable 'Age' in the data frame. Summary In this part of the tutorial, you learned how create and run submit functions.

By the end of this part of the tutorial, you'll be able to validate participant responses. Click here to see what your blackboard.ipynb and survey.py files should look like at the end of this part of the tutorial. Why validation? I often run studies where I elicit numerical estimates. Early on, I noticed that a small but annoying faction of participants, rather than entering actual numbers (e.g. 50), answered the question in full sentences: I believe the answer is fifty. We often need to make sure participants are entering the right kind of answer, whether it's typing the same password twice, answering a comprehension check by clicking on the correct choice, or entering a number instead of a word. Basic syntax Open your jupyter notebook and run the following: from hemlock import Input, Validate as V inpt = Input(validate=V.require()) inpt.validate Out: [<Validate 1>] You can add validate functions to a page or question by setting its validate attribute or passing a validate argument to its constructor Validate functions run when a participant attempts to submit a page. If the participant's response is valid, the function returns None , allowing the participant to continue the survey. If the participant's response is invalid, the function returns an error message. As its name indicates, the validate function requires the participant to respond to the input question. By default, the input question has no response. It also has no error message. We can see this as follows: ( 'The input has no response or error message', not inpt.response and not inpt.error ) Out: ('The input has no response or error message', True) Now, let's run the validate function. Because the input question has no response, the validate function will return an error message. This error message is stored in the input question's error attribute: inpt._validate() inpt.error Out: 'Please respond to this question.' Notes: You don't need to run _validate yourself in the survey; hemlock takes care of this automatically for you. require is just one of many prebuilt validate functions . Custom validation This is a good start, but what happens when someone enters a nonsense response for date of birth? For this, we're going to need a custom validate function. Let's see how to do this in our notebook: from datetime import datetime @V.register def date_format(inpt): try: # try to convert to a datetime object datetime.strptime(inpt.response, '%m/%d/%Y') except: # if this fails, the participant entered an invalid response return '<p>Format your date of birth as mm/dd/yyyy.</p>' inpt = Input(validate=V.date_format()) inpt.response = ''' I, George Thaddeus Thatch the Third, was born in the first fortnight of August 1792. ''' inpt._validate() inpt.error Out: Format your date of birth as mm/dd/yyyy. Code explanation First, we import datetime , a native python package for handling dates and times. Next, we register a new validate function with the @V.register decorator. The validate function takes the input question as its argument. In general, validate functions (and, as we will see, their cousins, submit, compile, and navigate functions) take their 'parent' (usually a branch, page, or question) as their first argument. The validate function tries to convert the input question's response to a datetime object and returns an error message if this fails. Validation in our app Now that we've seen how to add validation in our notebook, let's add it to our app. In survey.py : from hemlock import Branch, Check, Input, Label, Page, Range, Select, Validate as V, route from datetime import datetime @route('/survey') def start(): return Branch( Page( Input( '<p>Enter your date of birth.</p>', placeholder='mm/dd/yyyy', var='DoB', data_rows=-1, validate=V.date_format() ), Check( '<p>Indicate your gender.</p>', ['Male', 'Female', 'Other'], var='Gender', data_rows=-1, validate=V.require() ), # REST OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS PAGE HERE ), Page( Label('<p>Thank you for completing the survey!</p>'), terminal=True ) ) @V.register def date_format(inpt): try: # try to convert to a datetime object datetime.strptime(inpt.response, '%m/%d/%Y') except: # if this fails, the participant entered an invalid response return '<p>Format your date of birth as mm/dd/yyyy.</p>' Run the app again and try to continue past the demographics page; enter an invalid date of birth, leave some questions blank, and see your validation at work. Multiple validate functions You can attach multiple validation functions by setting validate to a list of functions. Validate functions run in the order in which you add them, stopping with the first validate function which returns an error. Try adding require to the date of birth question by changing validate=V.date_format() to validate=[V.require(), V.date_format()] . Run your app and leave the date of birth empty. The error message will be, 'Please respond to this question.' . Enter an invalid date of birth. The error message will be 'Format your date of birth as mm/dd/yyyy.' .
