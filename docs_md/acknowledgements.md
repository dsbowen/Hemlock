# Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my friends, family, and mentors for supporting me throughout hemlock's development, with special thanks to the following individuals:

Sarah Reed, who has contributed more to hemlock than anyone else. Her contributions include referring me to resources and APIs, discussing countless design decisions, testing the API, and being a constant source of support and encouragement.

Luke Sabor, for being the first to complete the hemlock tutorial and giving me invaluable feedback along the way.

Raman Thadani, for being the second to complete the hemlock tutorial and giving me invaluable feedback along the way, and for drafting the Mac setup instructions.

I created hemlock as a free tool for academic and non-profit researchers. I'm grateful that Sarah, Luke, and Raman share this spirit, assisting in their spare time, compensated only by my gratitude.
