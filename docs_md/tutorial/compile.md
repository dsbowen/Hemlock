# Compile

In the previous part of the tutorial, you learned how to run functions to handle form submission.

In this part of the tutorial, you'll implement a confirmation page using compile functions.

## Why compile functions?

Compile functions run just before a page's html is compiled. This allows us to make our survey responsive to participants.

In our case, we're going to make a confirmation page for the participant's demographic information.

## Basic syntax

Open your jupyter notebook and run the following:

```python
from hemlock import Check, Compile as C

check = Check(
    '<p>Select the correct answer.</p>',
    ['Correct', 'Incorrect', 'Also incorrect'],
    compile=C.shuffle()
)
check.compile
```

Out:

```
[<Compile 1>]
```

You can add compile functions to a page or question by setting its `compile` attribute or passing a `compile` argument to its constructor. Compile functions run just before a page's html is compiled.

The `shuffle` compile function shuffles a question's choices. (Or, if attached to a page, shuffles its page's questions).

Let's watch our compile function at work:

```
check._compile()
[choice.label for choice in check.choices]
```

Out:

```
['Incorrect', 'Also incorrect', 'Correct']
```

Run this a few times and notice how the order of the choices changes. This behavior is useful for comprehension checks, as we'll see later.

**Notes.**

1. You don't need to run `_compile` yourself in the survey; hemlock takes care of this automatically for you.
2. `shuffle` is just one of many [prebuilt compile functions](../compile_functions.md).

## Custom compilation

We're going to take the participant's responses to the demographics page and display them on a new page. We'll ask the participant to correct any errors by going back to the demographics page.

Let's see how to do this in our notebook:

```python
from hemlock import Input, Label, Page, Range, Select
from hemlock.tools import join

@C.register
def confirm(confirm_label, demographics_page):
    # get the participant's data from the demographics page
    demographics = [q.data for q in demographics_page.questions]
    # re-format the race demographic data
    race = demographics_page.questions[2]
    race = join('and', *(key for key in race.data if race.data[key]))
    demographics[2] = race
    # set the label based on the participant's demographics data
    confirm_label.label = '''
    <p>Confirm the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Date of birth: {}</li>
        <li>Gender: {}</li>
        <li>Race/Ethnicity: {}</li>
        <li>Marital status: {}</li>
        <li>Subjective socio-economic status: {}</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To correct this information, click '<<'.</p>
    '''.format(*demographics)
    
demographics_page = Page(
    Input(data='10/26/1992'),
    Check(data='Male'),
    Check(data={'White': 1, 'Black': 1}),
    Select(data='Never married'),
    Range(data='5')
)
confirm_page = Page(
    Label(compile=C.confirm(demographics_page)), 
    back=True
)
confirm_page._compile().preview()
```

### Code explanation

First, we register a new compile function with the `@C.register` decorator. The compile function takes the confirmation label as its first argument. In general, compile functions take their parent as their first argument. We also pass in the demographics page as the compile function's second argument.

Next, we add a back button to the page with `back=True`.

Then, we compile and preview the page.

`confirm` begins by gathering the demographics data from the demographics page. The data are well formatted to insert into our confirmation page except for race. For `Check` and `Select` questions, if the participant can select multiple choices, the data are stored as a dictionary mapping choice values (`'White'`, `'Black'`, etc.) to a 0-1 indicator that the participant selected that choice. We fix this with the following:

```python
from hemlock.tools import join

race_data = demographics_page.questions[2].data
race = join('and', *(key for key in race_data if race_data[key]))
demographics[2] = race
```

Note that `race_data[key]` evaluates to `True` if the `key` (`'White'`, `'Black'`, etc.) was selected. So the expression `(key for key in race_data if race_data[key])` means 'get all the keys (races) the participant selected'. The expression

```python
join('and', *(key for key in race_data if race_data[key]))
```

means 'join all of the selected keys with "and", e.g. "White and Black"'.

Finally, `confirm` adds the demographics to the confirmation label.

## Compilation in our app

Now that we've seen how to add compile functions in our notebook, let's add it to our app.

In `survey.py`:

```python
from hemlock import Branch, Check, Compile as C, Embedded, Input, Label, Page, Range, Select, Submit as S, Validate as V, route
from hemlock.tools import join

from datetime import datetime

@route('/survey')
def start():
    demographics_page = Page(
        Input(
            '<p>Enter your date of birth.</p>',
            placeholder='mm/dd/yyyy',
            var='DoB', data_rows=-1,
            validate=[V.require(), V.date_format()],
            submit=S.record_age()
        ),
        # REST OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS PAGE HERE
    )
    return Branch(
        demographics_page,
        Page(
            Label(compile=C.confirm(demographics_page)),
            back=True, terminal=True
        )
    )

...

@C.register
def confirm(confirm_label, demographics_page):
    # PUT YOUR COMPILE FUNCTION HERE
```

Run the app again to see your confirmation page.

## Summary

In this part of the tutorial, you implemented a confirmation page using compile functions.

In the next part of the tutorial, you'll learn how to set up navigation between branches.
