# Linux setup coming soon

Recommended software:

1. Python3 and pip3.
2. Hemlock-cli; `pip install hemlock-cli`.
3. Git and github.
4. A way to edit python code. Recommended visual studio code.
5. Jupyter notebook.
6. Google chrome
7. Chromedriver
8. Heroku and heroku-cli.

Let's be honest, if you're using Linux, you probably don't need detailed setup instructions anyway. (But they are coming!)
