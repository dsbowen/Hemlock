## For-profit and political research

If you're a marketing, political advertising, or other for-profit company interested in using hemlock, email me (Dillon Bowen) at <dsbowen@wharton.upenn.edu> with the subject heading *Hemlock for-profit*.

You may either:

1. Hire me as a consultant to make surveys for you.
2. Purchase a Hemlock Commercial License for developers at your company.

## Non-profit and academic research

If you're an academic or non-profit researcher interested in using hemlock for your research, email me (Dillon Bowen) at <dsbowen@wharton.upenn.edu> with the subject heading *Hemlock research*.

#### Collaboration policy

I appreciate that you may be wary of investing the time required to learn hemlock upfront, so **for a limited time I am offering to make studies for you using hemlock free of charge** (subject to my time constraints as a PhD candidate).

In return, I expect that you will:

1. Cite hemlock in any publications which result from our collaboration.
2. Mention hemlock in any talks related to our collaboration (e.g. "we created our studies using hemlock; a python package for behavioral science research").
3. Include a link to the hemlock documentation, <https://dsbowen.github.io/hemlock/>, in any slide decks related to our collaboration.
4. If you would like me to make multiple studies, or a single complex study which requires me to build new features or extensions, you should add me as a co-author.
